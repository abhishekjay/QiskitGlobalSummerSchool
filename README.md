# QiskitGlobalSummerSchool
This is a repository of the labs and final project that I did for Qiskit Global Summer School
The lab folder has been divided in two: Unsolved lab exercises and Solved(my solutions to the same).
The final project code has been uploaded in the final project folder. It is a VQE algorithm to find the minimum eigenstate of a LiH molecule.
